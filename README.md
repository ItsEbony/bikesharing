# Bike-Sharing Analysis

We are considering opening a bike-share service in Des Moines, Iowa, similar that of Citibike in New York. As such, we have run an analysis on the more than 2.3 million rides taken in August 2019 using Citibike to determine whether it would be appropriate and profitable in Des Moines. Before going futher, it is worth noting that as this data is based on a single month, we should investigate other times of the year for further analyses. 

## Observations 

### 1. There are significantly more men who use Citibike than any other gender. 
Men make up 1.5 million Citibike users, while women make up 588K and those who did not specify a gender account for 226K. 

### 2. A relatively large number of trips last four to six hours. 
Looking at our first chart, we see a peak from around four to six hours of trip duration.  

### 3. That trend is consistent across genders. 
When looking at trip duration based on gender, the trend remains the same with men, women and those who did not specify a gender. However, it is worth caveating that the spike we see in trip durations of four to six hours are much higher when looking at men.

### 4. Evening rush hour is when bike sharing is most active. 
Our heatmap shows that bikers reach thier peak activity from 5PM to 7PM, which overlaps with the evening rush hour. While the morning rush hour (7AM to 9AM) is also busier relative to other times of the day, evening activity is still much higher. 

### 5. When we break this down by gender, we find that the trend is driven by men. 
Dividing our heat map by gender, we see that the deep red indicating higher activity is shown when analyzing the activities of male bikers. 

### 6. Activity based on weekday is still mostly consistent across genders. 
While activity based on weekday across genders is mostly consistent. However, because men make up most of Citibike's customers, they show a darker blue down the line for higher activity. 

### 7. The subscription program appears to be effective. 
Of the Citibike users, 1.9 million were subscribers, while 444K were customers. Given that the overwhelming majority of people who used the service were subscribers, we can infer that mostly locals use Citibike and that the subscription option is effective in attracting and retaining users. 

## Summary 
Our current analyses are not sufficient to determine whether it would be advisable to launch a bike-sharing service in Des Moines and we should collect more data beyond what is offered by Citibike, including income information, population density, demographics, and average commute times and distances generally. 

That being said we should run a few other analyses before making a final decision, including: 

1. Looking at data over a larger time span -- such as a year -- visualized through a line chart to see how business might fluxuate during different season and what exactly triggers those changes in activity. 
2. Another visual that would be helpful would be an overlay of the most active start and stop locations and the median salaries of those areas to determine if income plays a part in use of bike-sharing.
